# Manifold-Multiscale-Representations

This package is complementary to the manuscript: 
"Multiscale Representations for Manifold-Valued Data," 
by Wael Mattar and Nir Sharon. See (arXiv link) TBA.

The code aims to realize a construction of mulltiscale transform for manifold-valued data based upon an approximating subdivision scheme.

Disclaimer: The package is yet to be fully finalized for publication (ETA: TBA).
