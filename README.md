# Manifold-Multiscale-Representations

This package is complementary to the manuscript: 
"Multiscale Representations for Manifold-Valued Data," 
by Wael Mattar and Nir Sharon. See https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.00866.

The code aims to realize a construction of multiscale transform for manifold-valued data based upon an approximating subdivision scheme.
